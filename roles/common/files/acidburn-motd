-------------------------- NOTICE -----------------------------------------
All accounts, storage, VMs, and services have been migrated to new infra.

IRC users: I attempted to start weechat in tmux/screen as you hoping you might
have some autoconnect settings set. If you didn't, then I exited the tmux/screen
session. I did not look any anyone's data or PMs or whatever else you might
be hiding.

Homedirs are now mounted at /nfs/cistern/home and are about 2 (maybe 3) weeks out of date
so the old home is mounted at /nfs/tank/home if you would like to copy files over.

Please report any issues to #vtluug-infra on irc.
